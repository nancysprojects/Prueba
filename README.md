"The Three States
Pay attention now — here is the main thing to remember about Git if you want the rest of your learning process to go smoothly. Git has three main states that your files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged:

Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.

Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot."
